Networking basics.
Open Systems Interconnection model(OSI model):

1. Physical Layer - converts BITs to SIGNALS and transports over media

2. Data link layer - allows upper layers to access media and controls how data is  placed and received from the media

3. Network layer - works on transmission of received data segments from 1 comp to another located in different networks

4. Transport layer - Controls reliability of Communication thru segmentation, floww control and error control

5. Session layer - Helps in setting up and managing connection enabling sending and receiving data followed by termination

6. Presentation layer - Does translation, data compression and Encryption

7. Application layer -
